          "Barcelona will eliminate ALL tourist apartments in 2028 following local backlash: 10,000-plus licences will expire in huge blow for platforms like Airbnb - Olive Press News Spain ",
          "Fuck Airbnb",
          "Those 10k will hardly enter the normal rental market. They are renovated to look all fancy and cute. If it would normally cost 1500, then it will cost 4k and trust me, there will be a market for that. So most probably those tourist apartments will never be accessible to the general public anyway",
          "Tourist appartements are not the problem as they are regulated. 10.000 existing licenses are not much, it’s a normal number that other big cities have everywhere in the world. It is such a easy and populistic blame for politicians but tourists are important for the industry and economy of the city. The biggest problem is that the government is not doing anything against MID TERM RENT. Nobody rents out there appartement long term because the rental price is capped. But if your rent rooms or do a mid term rent 1-12 months, you can charge as much as you want. This is exactly what makes the prices so extremely high. If the government would change and make a cap for mid term rent the market would change significantly. Blaming 10.000 tourist appartements and taking the license away won’t change a thing because the owners spend so much money on them they will sell them for high prices or rent them mid term for whatever amount they want to charge.",
          "Apartments should not be an investment. There should be a HUGE tax for apartments that are empty, or exponential tax for any apartment past, dunno, two. So that the capital is not located in them.",
          "The fucking olive press. 🤦",
          "You will get rid of Airbnb, but the prices on rent will not decrease. Inflation and demand are linear, with demand being more volatile as well.\n\nAirbnb should be banned because of the problem it causes, I am in favor of the ban, but this is not going to impact the market in terms of price.",
          "I get all the hatred to the massive use of airbnb, but really, I think the biggest reason why there are so many tourists everywhere is bc the price of plane tickets is ridiculously low. \n\nAnd please correct me if I am wrong but airlines aren't being taxed accordingly for the contamination they create, otherwise the prices wouldn't be that cheap.",
          "This is the stupidest shit. First of all, there's demand for tourist apartments! Look what happened in NYC when they effectively banned Airbnb: hotel prices shot up like crazy because, get this, people want to visit NYC! The same will happen in Barcelona. The most important thing for housing affordability is simply *building more housing*",
          "And when will Barcelona adapt their electric installation at the port so cruise ships can plug in instead of blasting their engines 24/7?\n\nAnd don’t come here saying “hurt durr they should just get rid of cruise ships” coz we know that’s never gonna happen.",
          "This is not going to make rental prices decrease. You are delusional if you think 10K apartments are the problem.\nI don't care if they remove Airbnb since it creates problems for the residents though, so I'm fine with it being banned, but you are not going to see cheaper rent prices because of this.",
          "So hotels will be 2 times more expensive, only for rich people (and illegal migrants, and thiefs of proprty of course).",

I left that apartment as soon as I could because while many guests were respectful of the residents in terms of noise and behavior, there are those who certainly weren't (looking at you young Brits) and never knowing if they'll let you sleep on a given weeknight is a source of anxiety in itself.\n\nNow I live in a smaller but more touristy town and the crowds are unbearable in the old city from June-September.

There are signs warning people booking through ABnB they aren't welcome and can be reported to the police.

But when landowners or businesses starts buying up apartments all over the place, leasing them out for renting, renting out 1/3 of an apartment block that could easily fit 10-15 couples or families, it starts being a big problem. Suddenly one guy or a company can buy you out any day because they got so much cash on hand, just for those same apartments to stand empty 30%-40% of the time (that's the stats I've overheard here) \n \nMy town is kinda small and not a very big tourist attraction, so imagine this in a city like Barcelona, where you could probably have an issue 10 times as big.\n\nEDIT: Typos",

Guess who rents these places? For sure not spanish families.\nBut where I live, for example, I know plenty of spanish families that own several apartments themselves and they prefer renting them out to a spanish couple/family from October to June....guess where they put the apartment the rest of the summer months? Yep, AirBnB and co. Or they just raise the price so much that even though you can rent the place the whole year, you are unable to pay it (as a normal spanish worker, im not even saying someone who has a precarious job)....\nThe problem lies as well within the regulations. The government is doing jack sh*t about it and everyone is abusing it. Everyone is taking advantage of it. Everyone but the normal people... la gente de a pié.

          "I've never seen these kinds of notes outside of big cities with way too many tourists already (e.g. Barcelona, San Sebastián). I suspect they tend to appear in nationalist/separatist hot spots.\n\nIndividual tourists can experience some uncomfortable moments, but I wonder whether these energies would be better spent organizing in a serious way for better regulation. Article 47 of the Constitution expressly guarantees the right to \"dignified and adequate\" housing, and requires the state to impede real estate speculation, applying regulations \"in the general interest\" and using the profits of state enterprises to fund public programs. It seems, however, that the anarchy of the market, increasingly dominated by foreign capital, supersedes the law, and hence this unpleasant note born of unaddressed frustration.\n\nThe cultural element, the fact of tourism and hospitality being generally terrible industries to work in, the immense brain drain of educated young people who can't find jobs outside of said industries, the logistics of masses of people, huge numbers of foreign tourists who don't speak Spanish, or Catalan, or what-have-you, are also of course at play. Few people like to see tourists become the majority of people in town, and then there is the usual distrust and xenophobia typical of any place on earth, but especially Europe. Also, while many under-developed or abandoned communities welcome tourist money -- certainly the bosses do -- I think that most people understand (although politicians don't usually care) that de-industrialization was a bad policy and putting all of our eggs in one basket (tourism) is just not a good way to develop and advance the real economy (not to mention the hopes, dreams, or salaries) of regular people.\n\nSo tourism helps drive property speculation and, together with other factors, adversely affects the culture and development of local communities. I think almost everyone is acutely aware of the effects in their own ways, although of course there are a range of opinions. Many people are die-hard fans of tourism and don't want to see it regulated or made more sustainable; I can't fathom not wanting a better balance, which opens the possibility of a mutually enjoyable experience for both locals and visitors.\n\nI hope you enjoy your time in Spain.

Is it so that tourists go home and tell everyone how unwelcome they felt and then word spreads? \n\nAirbnb is terrible of course, but Spanish rental prices and house prices are driven by more complicated macroeconomic forces. There is a squeeze on supply caused by years of not building many homes (due to the collapse of the sector and then under-investment after the crisis).

However, as a Spaniard who lives abroad and has a property on the seaside of Alicante I can see how the situation is becoming complicated for locals. \n\nThis is what I have observed: \n\n1. Accommodation prices (buying or renting) keep going up, increasing the frustration of locals trying to buy or rent spaces. People who may have been living/visiting the same town for their entire lives need to go somewhere else. Stronger economies (e.g. North of Europe) are the only ones who can afford those accommodations/places. \n\n2. Restaurants and shops cater primarily to tourists and visitors. This is something that surprised me considerably. When I was a teenager the area was full of Spanish restaurants and local food. Now the most common restaurants are pizza and burger places. To my surprise most of these places are neither owned nor operated by locals. This aspect seems to add to the frustration of many locals. You still have some paella places, but the food diversity seems to be dying.\n\n3. Traffic and parking. More visitors typically means more traffic and more issues finding parking. Torrevieja is a great example of this problem. \n\n4. Everybody is blamed for the flaws of a few individuals. It seems that Alicante being one of the cheapest seaside areas of Europe makes it very attractive for young people around the world. People in their early twenties looking to party hard and have fun. Typically this involves a significant amount of noise (even for Spanish standards!), and some level of chaos on the streets (pee, broken glasses, etc.). As one may expect, people who live in the area on a regular basis are very annoyed by these problems that happen recurrently every year. \n\nIn summary, sorry that somebody tried to make you feel unwelcome there.

If you go to a private homeowner and see that prohibition in his contract, you can ask him to take it off, but questions will be asked.\nNormally they don't like the idea of you subletting because you can A) make more money than them, and B) they have no idea who's staying at the place.\nAgencies are a bit different, but also have the same problem: They tend to send you the shittiest contract you have ever seen, with you waiving all the RIGHTS you have by law. It's an absurd situation, because you pay these agencies a shitload of money, but they DON'T see you as their client. They see the homeowner as their client. You have to actually tell them: \"hey, this contract is shite, I do not want to waive all my rights, so make a contract that is fair to me. I'm not paying you 500+ EUR to rip me off.\"\n\nI have never been able to get the sublet-prohibition removed, except for one time, where I wanted to sublet my house to my own company, so I could technically and legally work from home. The agency made a very specific exception for only companies that were under my name, so that I wouldn't be able to sublet it to other companies.\n\nIf you are thinking of illegally renting out 1-2 rooms on airbnb... Think twice. Most cities (incl. Parma) require that your place gets a license to be able to rent it on airbnb. ([see more..](https://www.caib.es/seucaib/es/tramites/tramite/1095724)) If your contract prohibits it, you won't get a license either.

There are no dangerous areas, no no-go zones, no \"don't walk two blocks in that direction\", no guns, no gangs, etc.\n\nThat being said, pickpockets are certainly a plague in touristic areas, and you are almost guaranteed to be targeted if you are careless with your belongings. Be careful with the gangs of Roma kids. I don't know if this is racist or profiling, but if you are eating or having some coffee and a small gang of 4-5 kids start begging a browsing around, make sure you phone or your camera is not sitting on the table.

Watch your stuff as theft is an issue but no need to go crazy about it.\n\nAll of that said, I can't guarantee that it won't happen, because shit happens everywhere but violent thefts (mugging type) are VERY uncommon.

We know already what happens when you overproduce, and, for those who don't know, it doesn't lower the prices, but increases them.\n\nThe problem in Spain, and in most of Europe, is not the offer. It's the demand. And that demand is rooted in tourism.\n\nYou see, people go where there are jobs. And those jobs are in the cities. And in a country where tourism is a major chunk of their economy, those jobs are concentrated around the center of the cities.\n\nThat means tourists, businesses and citizens compete for the same spot. That's what raises the prices: the jobs are localized in one spot.\n\nThat's why it doesn't matter how much you build. Owning and renting in a city is so profitable that any new promotion will be absorbed by investors. Renting will be slightly more accessible, yet tourists will pay more, so effectively it will increase the tourism. That will create new jobs. Not just tourism related, but for services for the people who attend this tourism and other sectors, like technology, where they can afford the prices and can call foreigner workers to work in an urban theme park.\n\nBecause new jobs happen, people want to go there to find a job, so it increases the demand. That increases how profitable housing and renting is so, again, any new promotion is purchased by investors. And that feedback loop will keep on until the city deteriorates so much that the tourism stops growing.\n\nFor more questions about what will happen, let's take a look at New York. A polluted and noisy sink hole under the shadow of their own buildings where, despite having half-empty skyscrapers, the prices don't go down the millions of dollars.\n\nNo wonder that the ones who advocate for building more and bulldoze the cities in the process is the housing market.

Ignoring this doesn’t help. \n\nLook at your neighbours, the Portuguese - if you stop randomly anywhere in Portugal, somebody will be able to talk to you either in English or in Spanish. They adjusted because at some point the reality hit them: times have changed and their language lost influence world wide. Their economy is less developed that Spain’s, but their language skills and motivation helps them at least find job in a different country.\n\nGoing back to the reasons I write this: my kids speak Spanish and English and their native language. Their friends in the neighbourhood speak only Spanish. If there was something I have to thank my parents for was spending time and money so I could learn English and French and have better chances of getting a better paid job.\n\nWe are part of a great community and we do things together. None of my neighbours share my view about foreign languages . Furthermore they think only friends and networking is enough to get things done. Which is true to a certain point. Afterwards is the skills that count. And it is a global market.\n\nHave you ever wondered why all the big IT companies have support and R&D centers in Romania? Because of the lower labour costs, which nowadays are similar with Malaga’s and because of the language and technical skills. There they can hire positions with 14 different languages plus English.  Andalucia has the lower labour costs, but lacks the language skills. From Malaga to Manilva there are a lot of consulting companies hiring people for entry level jobs in consulting with French, German, Dutch, Norwegian, Danish or Finnish plus English. And they only attract young nationals from these countries that will enjoy their 20s and 30s in Spain, gain experience and move to other places. Thus Spain also loses the know how that would benefit the country a lot.\n\nIf I wouldn’t care for the place where I live and where my kids grew and call home, I wouldn’t waste my time writing this or trying to positively influence some teenagers lives.",

Businesses also benefit from finding foreign workforce by offering \"working in the most cosmopolitan city in the world\". They benefit staying together to juggle workers between different companies. Even the positioning of the offices is used in negotiations.\n\nAnd who pays the price of businesses making profits of hyperdense populations?  The same as always.

Fly, drive, train?\n\nOr?\n\n* 10/27 rent car in BCN, drive 6 hours to San\n* 10/28 all day in San. Keep car.\n* 10/29 Drive to Madrid, at our own leisure. $120 USD + gas for entire car trip. That is a lot of driving in 3 days though.\n\nother options?? Fly to San Sebastian, drive to Madrid?\n\nWhat's your thoughts? I'd like to get into Madrid close to 6pm 10/29 to be respectful to our hosts.",
          "I don't mind driving that much, but if you don't like it or find it taxing I would go with transport options\n\nI would say the flight to San Sebastián is easiest hands down. Yeah you miss some nice scenery but the train and bus are both long and slow.\n\nTo get to Madrid things get more complicated.\n\nIf you happen to be into churning, it's a really good option to use avios to fly from San Sebastián or even Bilbao. It's best to transfer them to Iberia and book from there, but that gets a bit complicated and not worth going into unless you actually want to do it.\n\nYou can look into just paying for flights from Bilbao. Air Europa and Iberia fly that route. This is what my company normally uses to get people between the Bilbao and Madrid offices, but we are paying for time so it changes the cost/benefit a lot.\n\nYou can check the train schedule and prices at www.renfe.com. Unfortunately the trains to the Basque Country are rather slow and actually slower than just driving so keep that in mind.\n\nPersonally, I would actually probably go with the bus. www.alsa.es is the website of the bus company. There is normal service and then Supra service. If it's not too much of a price difference, I find the Supra to be very worth it. It's like long haul business class on an airplane. The seat doesn't turn into a bed or anything, but it's very comfortable and you have an in seat entertainment system. The premium is even more swanky if you really want to splurge.",

          "Yes, registering on airbnb only works with a tourist license number which gets checked directly from adjutament. They work together very close",
          "Those cute AirBnBs are chapuza city.  Cute, but definitely not worth 4K in a regular market.",
          "So they will focus on high end rental market, freeing normal appartments for normal people? Good!",
          "This is total bs. I rented air bnb in Alicante with my family last month. I live in Poland, there are many tourists comming from Poland and our GDPs are almost equal and Poland's been lower for a great time.\n\nThe trip was cheaper than renting a hotel room and that's why we've chosen it. \n\n10 days in Reyes Católicos (check it out, great place, city Centre next to the beach) costed us around 4000pln (less than $1000). \n\nCounter offer from hotels? Around twice or three times that.. \n\nI wouldn't complain if you made that cheaper, I don't see how though.",

          "No they're not. It's basic economics that supply balances demand by changing the price. What you're seeing now is the price with the current demand balancing the current supply. As you said there's lots of demand in barna relative to supply..I.e. inelastic supply. In those cases even when adding a small amount to the supply side has a big impact on prices. And yes I'm looking forward to seeing!",

          "Well said",
          "We've gone way above the limits of what could be a reasonable amount of tourism, so every single step that makes people less prone to come here as tourist is good in my book.\n\nNot that this is going to fix the underlying issues, but hey, something's something.",

Don't act like  a dickbag  and respect the people and place you visit.\n\nGoing to San Sebastian next week for the third time in since 2023, and I have not had one negative experience in San Sebastian, Madrid, Barcelona, or La Rioja.\n\nMy sister has being going to San Sebastian every summer for the past 5 years and loved it so much she bought an apartment (which  where we stay - and no she doesn't rent it out)\n\nIf anything, I go out of my way to spend $$$$$ on local businesses and buy made in Spain goods.",
          "That's great. A country cannot live only of tourism.\n\nFor the locals, it's even better. Why any worker will want an average 200€ salary increase when the renting increases by 400€, the shopping increased by 200€, and the center has become an expensive theme park.\n\nPeople is losing purchase power so a couple of big owners are becoming rich selling our cities.",

          "I live in Marbella and the entire local economy is built around tourism. There's almost no other industry, and we were hit hard by the pandemic.

          "Airbnb started as a great thing. \nHave a room empty or even an apartment empty? Or going on vacation and leaving your house empty for a while? Hey, rent it out when it’s available. \n\nBut it became more profitable to rent a place 2 months, than 12 months. So now there are in some places +50% of the apartments empty a whole year except for summer. The locals see the prices skyrocket because of this and with their local salary cannot even pay rent. \n\nIt’s actually super logical. If can ask 150% of a month rentprice PER WEEK via airbnb.",
          "Spent several days in Alicante last September. Zero problems with the locals.  Sounds like it's an AirB&B thing not a tourist thing.",
          "As of 2022, tourism is 11% of Spain’s GDP, drives 9.3% of our employment, and tourism exports accounted for 5.7% of GDP in 2023. \n\nI would say those figures are even higher here in Alicante.",

          "Tourists are always welcome, imo. They are a main driver of the local economy. Don't let short-sighted folks deter you. I enjoy the privilege that tourists bring. Without tourists, the local economy would suffer tremendously.  Besides, fuck those people- they're suffering from a condition of acute arrogance. I guarantee they're not born/raised here.

          "They welcomed your money just fine.",
          "I stayed in Alicante for a while a few years ago and had no problems as an American tourist I saw tons of tourists most were English or other Europeans. It was pretty cool the castle/fort was disappointing almost the entire thing had been built recently and it was mostly fake, when I went there they were setting up a concert or something, view was amazing tho. People kept telling us how polite and nice we were for Americans I guess most Americans are rude as hell?",
          "There’s literally only so much waterfront land and the exploration phase of earth is over. Now its the hording phase. Shits going to be contested til the end of time, airbnb or not. This a global real estate market now. Hopefully each city will regulate vaction rental licences or else these places wont be worth visiting. That said, I am glad I can rent a home and experience local life or beach life that I wouldn’t be able to otherwise.",
          "I’ve never used Airbnb, and never will. Despite various family members extolling its virtues. It’s always seemed shady to me and I had a feeling it would go this way. It was inevitable, in my opinion. But the move fast and break things culture must never be questioned because it’s come up with the greatest advancements in human social interaction ever. Like Facebook, Twitter..You know, those things that have so greatly and universally made life better and lead to peace, harmony and mutually respectful behaviour.",

          "This is helpful to read. My husband and I are in Spain right now from the US and have had many, many wonderful one-on-one interactions with people living here. I imagine it helps that we speak Spanish well. So individually we have felt loved but it makes sense that “massified tourism” would exhaust the local community. I heard a British person yesterday snap at a waiter and say “more agua, garçon” 🤦‍♀️whew",
          "That is very understandable thank you.",
          "Towns? My town is alright, maybe you meant cities?\n\nYoung people are being forced to leave their towns because there are 0 jobs there, and they leave for the city, driving prices in urban areas high.\n\nCity housing is unaffordable but you can just live in your town if it has good public transport (bus) with your workplace.\n\nI hope the government keeps the transport subsidies and makes more rural lines, they are pretty good even if it's not an optimal solution.",
          "Well said!",
          "Yes all these comments have definitely opened my eyes to this. I wasn’t aware of how people felt here about tourism. To me my only thing was I want to travel to experience even a small amount of another country. Otherwise I have loved it here and had a great time and I intend on keep doing so. Just this note last night shocked me a little.",
          "I just spent 2 weeks in Spain and I've never seen a nation so devoted to tourism. Entire cities with no industry (outside of olive oil/wine), just endless service-based businesses.\n\nFantastic time, loved the ppl and places. However, it would crush Spain's economy to restrict tourism",
          "That’s understandable thank you.",
          "Spaniard here. It's a bad situation but not your fault, feel free to rent anything if needed. Also, we are still alive because of tourism anyway: it supports our businesses a lot",
          "As a spaniard I can tell you it's definetly not your fault but the landlords. They are massively buying flats, houses and even whole buildings to list them in AirBnB or similar platforms.\n\n  \nClassical tourism is more than welcome, but Airbnb is a direct threat to our chances of obtaining decent housing at an affordable price.\n\n  \nOnce again, NOT YOUR FAULT, you're more than welcome here, but we'd welcome you more in the future if you get a hotel (if you can afford it) or a licensed vacational apartment.\n\n  \nApologies if this seemed rude in any kind of way, I don't mean it by any means.\n\n  \nPS. You should also visit Valencia, Barcelona, A Coruña and Málaga (:",

          "Did you mean 18? 80? I would love it if my rent only went up 8% in four years, its gone up 10% since I started living here like 18 months ago",
          "8% in 4 years isn’t too bad. Home prices where I live have gone up 80-130%. I own a smaller place at 2x the price my parents paid for theirs.",
          "Honestly hotels are way cheaper than AirBnB in most cases.",
          "As people say, don't take it personally. You're not endangered in any way. The note they left comes out of the frustration of the local people that cannot afford to live in their ancestral neighborhoods do to high-volume investors buying up in town centres and driving rents beyond what's affordable.\n\nPlease do consider this in the future, the safest bet is to stay in Hotels that are much better regulated for impact to the local communities than AirBnB.\n\nEnjoy your stay!",
          "Btw, Airbnb it's not the only place you can book apartments. My last booking with Booking.com was an old airbnb so you have to pay a bit of attention but at least that's an effort that some people won't even consider. Enjoy your stay!",
          "As long as you're aware and try to travel as sustainably as possible, it's okay. You're here anyways, and I genuinely hope you continue enjoying it! I do love seeing other people enjoy their time here, I just wish the government did something, and that tourists also learned about the situation and tried to travel sustainably. Thank you for being understanding of our situation!",

We were with another couple and we each have two kids.  I guess we seemed safe. They let us know it was the only Airbnb in the complex and they are being constantly scrutinized. To make sure no parties happen there, they had to install a sound detector that alerts authorities if sounds inside the apartment got too high. We tried to keep our kids from triggering it lol.",

Also a lot of times it is cheaper to fly from Madrid to Barca (I know it doesn't make sense but you should look into it).

It can get 44 Celcius in the shadow. As you are a canadian I will fall for the stereotypes and belive that you don't have much experience with heat so I would recommend you to skip Andalucia region in august or at least prepare the sunblocker 100 spf, is very common to see foreigns red as tomatoes in spain in summer.\n\nIf heat is not a problem you will love Seville. If you played Final Fantasy XII you will find the Alcazar surroudings pretty similar to Rabanastre. Is awesome.",
          "/r/barcelona has a good wiki for visitors",
          "> but most importantly we love Spanish history and museums\n\nI think you need to plan a few days in Madrid and go to the Prado Museum (Goya, Velazquez, etc.) and Reina Sofia Museum (Picasso, Dalí, etc.). And walk the city centre and live the life of the city.\n\nIMHO avoid Valencia completely and as others suggested go north to Bilbao. There you can drink sidra and eat pintxos and visit the Guggenheim Museum.\n\nThis way you're visiting more cultures inside Spain: Madrid (central), Bilbao (north), Barcelona (mediterranean) and Sevilla (south, Andalucian: they're special on they own).\n",
          "IMO, Sevilla is  A LOT more worthy checking out than Valencia. I like to think of Sevilla as the heart of spain and people there is very, very nice.\nAlso, if you want to control the budget A LOT, just don't go to tourist traps. those are usually restaurants with big paella signs. Ask a local or use tripadvisor.\nIn Barcelona you should visit Gaudi architecture(park Güell, sagrada familia, la pedrera, etc...), La Basílica de Santa María del Mar, Ciutadella Park, the born market. there's a little sqare... It's kinda a hidden place but I really like it. Still breathes semi-recent history. It's Called Plaça felip Neri and it's totally  my favourite place in Barcelona. You should inform yourself what happened there and see it with your own eyes.\nTo end the visit in Barcelona you should totally go to la font Magica. It's free and really beautiful. In august expect LOTS of people there. Can't really talk about Valencia, I went there just once and did not like it at all. But there are some museums worth cheking out. I've been lots of times in Madrid but never did tourism so I can't tell anything about it.",
          "I'll chip in here to suggest a day trip to Tarragona. It's a small city, an hour away from Barcelona going towards Valencia, with a lovely atmosphere and rich history. It was one of the capitals of the roman empire and there are some great museums and ruins (colosseum, walls, circus). The old town, including the cathedral, is within the roman walls at the top of the hill, and is such a beautiful place to wander around for a day. If you do come, let me know and I'll buy you a beer!\n\nSource: Brit, lived here for 3 months so far :)",
          "Just to chime in with/against others, I'd recommend at least one or two days more in Madrid. 4-5 days in Barcelona is a good idea IMO - you could even do a day trip to Girona, probably Catalonia's most beautiful city and a GoT filming location, if that interests you.\n\nI'd skip Valencia. It's a nice town but there really isn't a huge amount to see. If you had an extra week or two, I'd say include it. Same goes for Bilbao. Save these places for your next trip.\n\nGranada is a must. The Alhambra is the finest example of Islamic architecture in Europe, and IMO one of the most beautiful buildings in the world.\n\nSeville is also lovely. Just spending half a day going to a couple of bars, drinking chilled red wine and eating delicious tapas is one of my fondest memories of traveling in Spain.\n\nWhen I've traveled in the past, I've done 2 different types of trip: the type where we have tried to fit a dozen things in and the type where we stuck to 2-3 places. The second type is, in my opinion, a far better way of doing it, for two reasons: firstly, you can never see everything, so there's no point trying. Secondly, if you rush around you'll never really experience Spain in summer, which is all about slowing down. It's like Menorca, where we go on vacation most years (and where you must go on your next trip!) - you can tell how long people have been on the island by how they behave. New arrivals rush around, people who have been for a week or two are way more chilled.\n\nSo yeah, best bet is: Madrid > BCN > Granada > Seville > Madrid.\n\nAnyway, for Barcelona and environs, I'm a mod on the /r/Barcelona sub. We've got a [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Barcelona/wiki/) with lots of info in it and tons of old posts with tips and advice. Feel free to PM me if you need any advice.",
          "Granada is such a cool little city. I studied there last summer and I loved it. So much to do! The Alhambra is a must (I'm sure you know that already...). If you and your wife are into night life, then Mae West is an awesome discoteca. The shops are good and all located down one street in the central area of town (Reyes Catolicos I believe). There's only two American chain restaurants (last time I checked)- Dunkin Donuts & Burger King. Other than that, there's so many local restaurants that are worth trying instead of the same old American places. The gelato stores are so good- I'd recommend trying them! Have fun! Granada holds such a special spot in my heart ",

If you want to see Alhambra get tickets asap. You don't need a lot of time in Valencia either but there are some things worth seeing (Biografico was awesome!) Don't skimp on time in Madrid, Seville, or Barcelona, but be warned that Barcelona will be at its tourist peak and it will be swarmed. If you want a good beach day go somewhere on Costa Brava or to Casteldefels. Madrid has many many beautiful museums and parks while Barcelona mostly offers building tours of Gaudi's work and the Picasso Museum (those the museum of art of Catalunya was very nice). For hotels vs AirBnB just go with what is cheaper and best proximity to metro or what location you want to spend the most time in. I did a combination of every type of lodging during my travels, it just comes down to what's most important for you in that city.",

Firstly, if Sevilla is part of your plans, great, but I wouldn't skip Valencia to go and see another, smaller Andalucian city even if it's nice.\n\nI think your itinery is fine as you're taking in the four main cities which each will give you plenty to do and see and have their own cultures. Valencia is good because it's got loads to see and do and it's not a tourist trap like the other cities but two nights should cover it as it's compact. And it's pretty cheap too. \n\nBilbao is worth a visit if you have the time/money but it's a bit out the way from everywhere else you're going. You should start saving again when you get home and do the Northern part of Spain on another trip, it's absolutely stunning.",

It specialises in youth \"exchanges\", usually year or semester long, but sometimes offer summer programmes. I put exchanges between commas because you don't actually have to host someone exchange. The actual gist of the exchange is cultural. You stay with host families through this too. I know for a fact there is a Turkish national organisation, got some friends in Turkey thanks to YFU.\n\nAlso, try erasmus+ and european union programmes. There might be offers, as even though Turkey is not in the EU, sometimes they do things together. These programmes would be the best as there are chances you wouldn't have to pay and may have costs covered. Spain has a pretty strong youth \"houses\"/clubs network very interconnected with EU programmes. Try also youth working camps, and wwoof. There are people everywhere that host people in exchange for some work, in wwoof these places tend to be farms, people opening eco villages and such vibe.\n\nLastly, if I may, if you want to learn Spanish I wouldn't recommend going to Madrid or Barcelona. If it's simply because of the cities and some experience of culture then go ahead. But chances are you'll end up speaking in English most of the time.",

          "Just booked a cruise departing from Malaga in November, where to spend a few days- a week traveling/sightseeing beforehand? Just get an AirBnB for a few days in Malaga? Or hop trains for a week or so around the southern part if the country? Or fly into the north area and make our way down? We aren't really too beachy, and will get enough of that on the cruise anyhow, so we would like to maybe do a bit of wine touring and visit some historic sights. It will be our first time traveling to Spain,  we are pretty excited!\n\nEdit: P.S. I **love** castles, or forts, or mosques, or cathedrals. Anything amazingly architectural with historic resonance I will gladly go out of my way to see. Unfortunately I just dont know much about Spain in general. ",
          "The Alcazaba, a castle climbing a hillside near the Malaga waterfront, is a wonderful place to explore on foot.  And we did a day trip to Cordoba from the Malaga area - the Great Mosque in Cordoba is an amazing place - I've been to Spain 3 times, and it's the only place I've made it a point to return to each time.",
          "If you like Sherry wine, you need to go to Jerez. If you're not so into fortified wines, Andalusia is generally too hot to have good wines that are generally in the north. (Rioja, Galicia, Duero, Bierzo, etc...)\n\nBut you could easily do Sevilla, Granada, and Jerez/Cádiz in a week.",
          "I do love castles! Cordoba is very doable, thanks for the tip. I love culturally rich excursions. ",
          "Ooh, maybe make that home base for a few days? The history and architechture look amazing. Anything you paricularly love?",
          "The Alhambra of course, buy tickets in advance, and the cathedral. The mirador of the Alhambra is also a favorite spot of mine.",
          "Granada has La Alhambra which is obviously touristy but it's a marvel. Be sure to book your tickets early online since there are a limited number.\n\nElsewhere there's obviously Madrid and Barcelona and the Northern coast has fantastic nature but I don't know that'd I'd try to pack it all into a week. I would say Sevilla with either a night or just a day trip to Córdoba, Granada and then either a day or two in Málaga itself if you want or maybe Cádiz.\n\nLook into Ronda as well and maybe rent a car for a day or two to go explore the smaller towns. In Andalusia you can find old abandoned castles that are just kind of by the side of the highway and explore with no entrance fee or anything.",
          "Thank you so much, your help is very much appreciated! Youve given me some great jumping off points for research. I agree about not trying to pack it all into a week, maybe we'll just stick to the south. Doing a more extended Northern Europe trip is already in the 5-10 year plan anyways.",

We also have interest in Seville and Granada (really want to see the Alhambra) but they are on the southern part of Spain and we might be pressed on time there. The main mode of transportation would be by train.\n\n* Option 1: Spend Days 7,8, and most of 9 in Toledo and Segovia which are close in proximity to Madrid where we will be located prior. Would be easiest in terms of travel.\n* Option 2: Take train to Seville from Madrid early on Day 7. Leave sometime in Day 8 to Granada. Take flight from Granada to Barcelona on Day 9.

You can take quick regional trains to both cities, and then from Madrid the high speed train to Barcelona.",

I actually still may be leaning this way, for the flexibility in schedule, price, and scenery.\nThe flight from BCN to San Sebastián is very cheap, but only 1 option on our travel day at 7am. \nYeah train schedules haven't been good. I'll look into bus options. ",

Bus doesn't do much from a time- savings though, which would then direct me back towards driving.\n\nAlso, as first time travelers, anything about this potential drive I should keep it in mind? It seems very standard freeway/ rural driving. I saw one comment about how stressful the drive to Madrid is, but he got tons of down votes so I'm guessing you all don't agree :).\n\nThx!!",

If you want to sightsee and check the rural side go adventurous, the roads are usually pretty safe, even the rural ones.",
          "Let me give you a few more then two.\n\nMadrid - Watching what must have been a few thousand walk by in a peace march right next to what I think was a pep rally showed me that the Spanish are way more engaged then the rest of us smart phone mesmerized drones.\n\nSeville, Granada and Toledo - Had all the the old world culture and charm that a new world man like me is looking for in this kinda trip.  Narrow streets full of tiny bars and cafes with excellent drinks.\n\nLeon and Burgos - The pilgrims give these cities a breathless fervour that so obviously inspired the works that fill them.  Also the Museum of Human of Human Evolution was fantastic.\n\nSan Sebatian - A vacationers paradise.  Food, drink, relaxing in the sun, calm  active bays and beaches.  If there is any activity you find fun, then you can find it here.\n\nBarcelona -  The Sagrada familia was the single most stunning work I saw.  Natural forms and the plays of light through this building are a testiment to both spirituality and the reason of man.",

          "From a Malaga perspective no, it is not expensive at all. Christmas is quiet and family centric and decidedly low season, high season being the spring/summer obviously. Hardly any tourists around and plenty of accommodation available, both short and longer term, at a fraction of the price you would pay in July and August.",

I'd love to spend a lot of time in those museums.

Any sights, restaurants, hotels. \n\nAny towns recommended as must-see along the way? We want to stop at Altea and Ronda. My only \"must see\" for this trip is the Alhambra (how far in advance can I buy tickets?), and we are both open to seeing anything and everything. The gf's only request is that we find time to relax and enjoy some tapas :)\n\nPlanning to stay in hotels and/or airbnb\n\nAny recommendations for Valencia, Madrid, and any cities/towns/villages in between are most welcome!!!\n\nThanks all!",
          "From Valencia stop in Oliva/Gandia - Definitely Denia and check out the Castle and old town and water front, then onto Javea (Xabia), Moraira, Calpe, Altea (definitely Altea old town, up the stairs,) Stop off in Cartagena and see the Roman ruins and amphitheater or skip Cartagena and head to Murcia and then onto Granada. Definitely Granada over Malaga but you can just as easily do both but try and give yourself 3 days in Granada and definitely check out the Alhambra and Albaicin.. Airbnb is excellent in Spain, just had a place in Toledo, Stayed in a 14th century home in the old town. Hotels are inexpensive along the way too.. When in Granada though try and find a hotel on a pedestrianized street lined with tapas bars. You will love it!",

          "Driving in Spain is easy as can be. Much easier than getting around in New Jersey that's for sure!\n\nStop signs are STOP like you're used to. Other signs are in Spanish because well, place names and road names are Spanish. Road signs stating yields, lane merges, over passes, exits, etc are all visual graphics and are very easy to understand. Also, Google Maps works flawlessly in Spain and has never let me down. The roads are in superb condition (just got back the other day after doing 1100 miles and not a single pot hole - smooth as glass) ",
          "Also, the trip you are talking about will put you on the AP7 from Valencia to Denia, then from Denia down the coast to hit up Javea, Moraira, Calpe, Altea you'd hop on the N332. From Altea you could go back out to the AP7 to hit Alacante or Murcia and down to Lorca where you get on the E15 / N342 / A92 to Granada.. I've done that exact drive before. Very nice! Along the way you will find convenient easy on/off rest stops. If you don't see the large signs for the gas station from the highway, beware as it usually means you have to drive a few miles off the highway to some little village that may or may not be open. Stick to the roadside stops. \n\nAlso, don't get a tall vehicle as many parking garages are height limited within the cities and get a vehicle that handles reasonably well and make it a manual diesel. Major highways are posted 70 mph (120 KPH) with 80-90 mph the norm. I always opt for a manual because on the highways you can have long grades both up and down and it's best in the twisting mountain roads. An automatic is a bit of a hinderance really. ",

We may want to pass thru a couple of towns but then stop along the way. I don't know if we are going to stop at a diff town each night so making all those stops may not happen. What would be a good central point between Valencia and Granada that would also serve as a good hub to explore from?",
          "Well, Denia is a great hub to hit a few of the places I mentioned. Guadalest, Javea, Altea, Moraira, Calpe. Then I would say hit Cartagena and from Cartagena straight to Granada.

His whole blog is really well done. \n\nHave fun on your trip!\n\nEdit: Since I'm giving out blogs, here's my post about [Gijón](http://pelodelarana.blogspot.com/2013/06/grand-tour-part-iii-going-downhill.html)",
          ">How did this come about?\n\nNo idea, I guess it happened out of nowhere?\n\n>Why is it done?\n\nProbably to let people know how long this commercials round will last for. No idea why companies would want to do that, but hey, it's a nice thing to do!\n\n>How long has this been a thing?\n\nAgain, no idea. The oldest one I can find on Youtube is [this one] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s140BSu5A2Y) from TVE1, dating back to 2006.\n\n>I think it's a really neat system. Is this done Spain wide or just certain cable companies?\n\nSpain wide. It also doesn't matter whether you have cable or not, you'll see the same regardless of how you get your TV (in fact I'd say national channels outside cable do it more often). \n\nAlso, cable/satellite isn't even that popular in Spain to begin with; only 25% of homes have cable. Most seem happy with just standard over the air TV.",

My girlfriend and I are coming to Spain for three months later this year, and we could use your advice on the last leg of our trip. \n\nWe'll be in Cadiz and Madrid in September and October.

We're planning on getting an Airbnb, so it shouldn't be an issue if it's not an area with hotels. \n\nWe're looking for a walkable area with restaurants, bars, coffee shops, access to public transportation, and a park if possible. We're in our late 20s and would like there to also be people around our age to practice Spanish with. ",

          "Any experiences with the Alpujarras in late December? Hi everyone!\n\nI've rented an adorable AirBnB in Pampaneira for a few days in late December, and I have a few questions for anyone familiar with the area. \n\nI'm pretty cold-hardy (having lived in Minnesota for four years, the winter lows occasionally getting to -34F/-36C), but I've been getting conflicting information about the climate and I need to know how to pack! According to a variety of weather websites, the average highs are a relatively sultry 55F/13C and the lows hover above freezing. To me, that's pleasantly brisk jacket weather. But I've seen pictures and heard-tell about relatively significant/lasting snowfall in the mountain villages-- are there typically wild swings in temperature? Should I be prepared for days that don't get much above freezing? Or is seriously wintry weather a bit of a freak event in the Alpujarras?\n\nOn a related note, I'm debating whether to rent a car or to take the bus from Granada. The car would be expensive and a pain in the butt, but would give me more freedom to explore other villages. The bus is very cheap, but I'm worried about reliability-- and being able to get back to Granada on New Years Eve. What would you recommend? \n\nFinally, are there extensive seasonal closures? My main goal in Pampaneira is to snuggle up with my partner by the fire and drink wine and enjoy jamon in the cute cottage we're renting, but it would be nice to be able to get basic provisions and have a dinner somewhere. :)\n\nThanks for your help, r/spain! I can't wait to visit your beautiful country.     ",
          "You're a doll. That's what I figured about the weather-- that the mild \"averages\" mean it could be really cold or really warm. \n\nAlsa.es unfortunately doesn't have dates out to December yet. Generally they have 3 buses a day to Pampaneira, but I am not sure if they run all 3 in the winter (much less on new years/nochevieja). \n\nI'll put Travelez on my list!!\n\nThanks again. :)",

It's been fun. Learn Spanish as soon as you can as a lit of people do not speak English (depending on area you move to).\n\nMaking friends is different from region to region. \n\nMake sure you are compatible with the weather.

It doesn't has coast, but in contrast, it is in the state of Andalucia (in the South of Spain). Do you think that Spaniards are friendly? Andalucia are the most friendly and nearliest people of spain (well, at least is his stereotype), they have a \"south\" accent really characteristic.

I'm also saving a lot of money by not having a car, car payments and car insurance cost. I love walking, riding public transport, and I'll definitely be getting a bicycle. The big gap in health insurance costs is also nice. \n\nI definitely experienced the loud parties in the streets of Madrid because I was there during pride week. I don't know if it bothers me too much as I tend to have a gift for tuning noise out. I also experienced the noise in Barcelona as the first part of my stay was right in the heart of the gothic. The second part of my stay was in Horta Guinardo, which is a very lovely neighborhood and much more quiet. I think I preferred being where all the action was in the city center. I definitely love the various music festivals in Barcelona. This year I went to Sonar which was a lot of fun. \n\nI'm glad to hear that the hospitals are great. I'm pretty much sick of healthcare in the US. \n\nAs far a Spain over Portugal, I think the marijuana social clubs in Spain are really appealing to me. I don't drink very often, but I do enjoy smoking which helps me a lot with sleep issues that I have. From what I understand marijuana can be a little more difficult to acquire in Portugal. I also like Barcelona's closer proximity to the rest of Europe for travel. So close to France.  Portugal was definitely an option though.

Living close to the beach (beachfront ideally with balcony towards sea) is a must for us. \n\nJust to relax, calm down and spent time together with no disturbations in nice environment.\n\nMy questions are :\n\n1) Which part of Spain would you recommend? As i said above, we want to relax on beach, take long walks in nature, no nightlife. We prefer smaller city, not very touristy oriented (we are travelling in offseason anyway), few friendly restaurants, cafes and one supermarket. Thats all we need. We will have car. \n\nWe are considering either: \n\n> Murcia region - Mazarron, Águilas or La Manga.\n\n> Almería\n\n> Valencia\n\n> Barcelona\n\n2) Is weather in october, november still suitable for beach activities? Can we swim till late november?\n\n3) As we also love hiking in mountains, ideal place should be also in reasonable travelling distance to mountains (or atleast some nature reserve with hills)\n\n4) I suppose accomodation will be no problem in October - we want to rent a house / flat via Airbnb, i am expecting to pay maximum 1100$ / month for appartment with kitchen + 2 rooms, ideally in beachfront with seaviews and balcony. There are numerous seaside flats in large building complexes, ranging from 600$/month - how can it be so inexpensive? Where is the catch?\n\n5) I will try to hold our monthly budget around 700$ or so (no eating out, we are qute savy). Is it reasonable?\n\nThank you!",

          "From what I understand, price makes sense (here in Canada prices are through the roof). I could speak up to 60min in spain/Portugal during my stay and use up to 1,5gb but only in Spain. I'll keep looking to try and find a company that would allow me to use data from both Spain and Portugal. Thanks for the help, really appreciated :) ",

It is such a easy and populistic blame for politicians but tourists are important for the industry and economy of the city. The biggest problem is that the government is not doing anything against MID TERM RENT. Nobody rents out there appartement long term because the rental price is capped. But if your rent rooms or do a mid term rent 1-12 months, you can charge as much as you want. This is exactly what makes the prices so extremely high. If the government would change and make a cap for mid term rent the market would change significantly. Blaming 10.000 tourist appartements and taking the license away won’t change a thing because the owners spend so much money on them they will sell them for high prices or rent them mid term for whatever amount they want to charge."

For sure not spanish families.\nBut where I live, for example, I know plenty of spanish families that own several apartments themselves and they prefer renting them out to a spanish couple/family from October to June....guess where they put the apartment the rest of the summer months? Yep, AirBnB and co. Or they just raise the price so much that even though you can rent the place the whole year, you are unable to pay it (as a normal spanish worker, im not even saying someone who has a precarious job)....\nThe problem lies as well within the regulations. The government is doing jack sh*t about it and everyone is abusing it. Everyone is taking advantage of it. Everyone but the normal people... la gente de a pié. We are f*cked.\n\nSo in the end, it is how we say in spanish: el pez que se muerde la cola.\nAlways the same. We create the situations ourselves, we escalate the situation to the max and then, when most of the people are piss*d off, we try to salvage the situation.\nWhat happens in between, like all the people negatively affected by it....we dont care.\nIt´s like: ande yo caliente, jo.dase la gente.\n\nBut hey, we are the country with the most hours of sun in the EU!

           "I've never seen these kinds of notes outside of big cities with way too many tourists already (e.g. Barcelona, San Sebastián). I suspect they tend to appear in nationalist/separatist hot spots.\n\nIndividual tourists can experience some uncomfortable moments, but I wonder whether these energies would be better spent organizing in a serious way for better regulation. Article 47 of the Constitution expressly guarantees the right to \"dignified and adequate\" housing, and requires the state to impede real estate speculation, applying regulations \"in the general interest\" and using the profits of state enterprises to fund public programs. It seems, however, that the anarchy of the market, increasingly dominated by foreign capital, supersedes the law, and hence this unpleasant note born of unaddressed frustration.\n\nThe cultural element, the fact of tourism and hospitality being generally terrible industries to work in, the immense brain drain of educated young people who can't find jobs outside of said industries, the logistics of masses of people, huge numbers of foreign tourists who don't speak Spanish, or Catalan, or what-have-you, are also of course at play. Few people like to see tourists become the majority of people in town, and then there is the usual distrust and xenophobia typical of any place on earth, but especially Europe. Also, while many under-developed or abandoned communities welcome tourist money -- certainly the bosses do -- I think that most people understand (although politicians don't usually care) that de-industrialization was a bad policy and putting all of our eggs in one basket (tourism) is just not a good way to develop and advance the real economy (not to mention the hopes, dreams, or salaries) of regular people.\n\nSo tourism helps drive property speculation and, together with other factors, adversely affects the culture and development of local communities. I think almost everyone is acutely aware of the effects in their own ways, although of course there are a range of opinions. Many people are die-hard fans of tourism and don't want to see it regulated or made more sustainable; I can't fathom not wanting a better balance, which opens the possibility of a mutually enjoyable experience for both locals and visitors.\n\nI hope you enjoy your time in Spain.

           "First, I think nobody should feel unwelcome while vacationing. However, as a Spaniard who lives abroad and has a property on the seaside of Alicante I can see how the situation is becoming complicated for locals. \n\nThis is what I have observed: \n\n1. Accommodation prices (buying or renting) keep going up, increasing the frustration of locals trying to buy or rent spaces. People who may have been living/visiting the same town for their entire lives need to go somewhere else. Stronger economies (e.g. North of Europe) are the only ones who can afford those accommodations/places. \n\n2. Restaurants and shops cater primarily to tourists and visitors. This is something that surprised me considerably. When I was a teenager the area was full of Spanish restaurants and local food. Now the most common restaurants are pizza and burger places. To my surprise most of these places are neither owned nor operated by locals. This aspect seems to add to the frustration of many locals. You still have some paella places, but the food diversity seems to be dying.\n\n3. Traffic and parking. More visitors typically means more traffic and more issues finding parking. Torrevieja is a great example of this problem. \n\n4. Everybody is blamed for the flaws of a few individuals. It seems that Alicante being one of the cheapest seaside areas of Europe makes it very attractive for young people around the world. People in their early twenties looking to party hard and have fun. Typically this involves a significant amount of noise (even for Spanish standards!), and some level of chaos on the streets (pee, broken glasses, etc.). As one may expect, people who live in the area on a regular basis are very annoyed by these problems that happen recurrently every year. \n\nIn summary, sorry that somebody tried to make you feel unwelcome there. I hope that this context helps to better understand the chaotic situation of Alicante."

I'm from Rome, so I can understand concerns with tourism related issues, but I think this is unrelated. And in general to be honest I quite dislike people telling tourists to leave and what not, seems quite aggressive towards them whereas the feeling should be redirected at policy makers to avoid the issue of flats being bought by foreigners driving up rent and property prices altogether.

It's an absurd situation, because you pay these agencies a shitload of money, but they DON'T see you as their client. They see the homeowner as their client. You have to actually tell them: \"hey, this contract is shite, I do not want to waive all my rights, so make a contract that is fair to me. I'm not paying you 500+ EUR to rip me off.\"\n\nI have never been able to get the sublet-prohibition removed, except for one time, where I wanted to sublet my house to my own company, so I could technically and legally work from home. The agency made a very specific exception for only companies that were under my name, so that I wouldn't be able to sublet it to other companies.\n\nIf you are thinking of illegally renting out 1-2 rooms on airbnb... Think twice. Most cities (incl. Parma) require that your place gets a license to be able to rent it on airbnb. ([see more..](https://www.caib.es/seucaib/es/tramites/tramite/1095724)) If your contract prohibits it, you won't get a license either.

           "You shouldn't really fear for your safety. If you heard about crime and criminality, don't think about violent crime, but more about pickpockets and con artists than anything. If you are the victim of a crime, chances are that you won't find for some time, and it will be more of a \"oh shit where's my phone!\" moment. There are no dangerous areas, no no-go zones, no \"don't walk two blocks in that direction\", no guns, no gangs, etc.\n\nThat being said, pickpockets are certainly a plague in touristic areas, and you are almost guaranteed to be targeted if you are careless with your belongings. Be careful with the gangs of Roma kids. I don't know if this is racist or profiling, but if you are eating or having some coffee and a small gang of 4-5 kids start begging a browsing around, make sure you phone or your camera is not sitting on the table. Outside of the more tourisitic areas, you don't need to be that paranoid and attentive (but don't leave your stuff unattended). As others have said, it's not that different to other European capitals.\n\nLastly, if you are not used to big cities, there are some sights that you might find scary or shady, but they are part of the background for city dwellers: homeless people, grafitti, prostitutes, small drug-dealers, kids smoking pot, etc. I'm not saying you will be seeing that all the time, but you could run into some of that if you wander the back streets. I know San Francisco relatively well and it's probably more scary than Madrid or Barcelona."

The main issue is that it's a big cruise port, so especially along Las Ramblas, you get a lot of people that don't even have time to file a police report or they will miss their boat.\n\nOutside of Las Ramblas, it's pretty much like the rest of Spain. Watch your stuff as theft is an issue but no need to go crazy about it.\n\nAll of that said, I can't guarantee that it won't happen, because shit happens everywhere but violent thefts (mugging type) are VERY uncommon. Thieves work by trying to get you not to notice they are thieving. It's just not their style to be that brazen."

Normally as a buyer you are protected by the Spanish constitution for a life long tourist license.

That is clearly a lack of enforcement rather than licensing. The average “funcionario” gives 0 damns and the police has his hands tied, as they need orders to evict people and courtrooms are overbooked, meaning that they get 0 eviction orders and landlords get 0 fines.\n\nThis will help on the short term with unruly tourists, but since the market just got tighter hotels will jack prices up, it will reduce tourism to half (with the associated money gone).\n\nYou also reduced inland tourism to Barcelona (tourists from Spain that want to visit Barcelona), which in general are unproblematic and are looking for cheap alternatives (they usually don't book all inclusive on hotels) as the Spanish economy is generally not as strong as those of the tourists…\n\nLiving situation will be drastically improved in terms of available flats, and maybe house market crashes, allowing a lot of people to buy.\n\nAll in all, zero net change, but a change in system always brings market opportunities."

We know already what happens when you overproduce, and, for those who don't know, it doesn't lower the prices, but increases them.\n\nThe problem in Spain, and in most of Europe, is not the offer. It's the demand. And that demand is rooted in tourism.\n\nYou see, people go where there are jobs. And those jobs are in the cities. And in a country where tourism is a major chunk of their economy, those jobs are concentrated around the center of the cities.\n\nThat means tourists, businesses and citizens compete for the same spot. That's what raises the prices: the jobs are localized in one spot.\n\nThat's why it doesn't matter how much you build. Owning and renting in a city is so profitable that any new promotion will be absorbed by investors. Renting will be slightly more accessible, yet tourists will pay more, so effectively it will increase the tourism. That will create new jobs. Not just tourism related, but for services for the people who attend this tourism and other sectors, like technology, where they can afford the prices and can call foreigner workers to work in an urban theme park.\n\nBecause new jobs happen, people want to go there to find a job, so it increases the demand. That increases how profitable housing and renting is so, again, any new promotion is purchased by investors. And that feedback loop will keep on until the city deteriorates so much that the tourism stops growing.\n\nFor more questions about what will happen, let's take a look at New York. A polluted and noisy sink hole under the shadow of their own buildings where, despite having half-empty skyscrapers, the prices don't go down the millions of dollars.\n\nNo wonder that the ones who advocate for building more and bulldoze the cities in the process is the housing market.

And Spain doesn’t dominate the world as it used to do. US does henceforth English is used as a lingua franca. Ignoring this doesn’t help. \n\nLook at your neighbours, the Portuguese - if you stop randomly anywhere in Portugal, somebody will be able to talk to you either in English or in Spanish. They adjusted because at some point the reality hit them: times have changed and their language lost influence world wide. Their economy is less developed that Spain’s, but their language skills and motivation helps them at least find job in a different country.\n\nGoing back to the reasons I write this: my kids speak Spanish and English and their native language. Their friends in the neighbourhood speak only Spanish. If there was something I have to thank my parents for was spending time and money so I could learn English and French and have better chances of getting a better paid job.\n\nWe are part of a great community and we do things together. None of my neighbours share my view about foreign languages . Furthermore they think only friends and networking is enough to get things done. Which is true to a certain point. Afterwards is the skills that count. And it is a global market.\n\nHave you ever wondered why all the big IT companies have support and R&D centers in Romania? Because of the lower labour costs, which nowadays are similar with Malaga’s and because of the language and technical skills. There they can hire positions with 14 different languages plus English.  Andalucia has the lower labour costs, but lacks the language skills. From Malaga to Manilva there are a lot of consulting companies hiring people for entry level jobs in consulting with French, German, Dutch, Norwegian, Danish or Finnish plus English. And they only attract young nationals from these countries that will enjoy their 20s and 30s in Spain, gain experience and move to other places. Thus Spain also loses the know how that would benefit the country a lot.\n\nIf I wouldn’t care for the place where I live and where my kids grew and call home, I wouldn’t waste my time writing this or trying to positively influence some teenagers lives."

I think it should be limited to only individuals being the owner of an Airbnb so that it isn't so easy for huge real estate companies with deep pockets to come in, out compete the average citizen trying to buy a home, and then turn it into a hotel without room service.\n\nIf you let individuals rent out their homes for limited number of days per year or maybe even allow only up to a fixed number (say 2 or 3 for example) properties per owner on platforms like Airbnb, then it makes it harder for real estate companies to come in and push locals out of their own cities while still allowing for people who are smart with their money to invest in something they have more control over than the stock market or crypto.\n\nTL;DR Real estate companies should not be allowed to have Airbnbs and should have hefty penalties for doing so if caught. Airbnbs should be a privelge limited to private citizens only and then maybe prices won't be so damn high for renting an Airbnb or for finding a place to live in any major city."

How do you recommend we (wife and I) travel between cities?

That is a lot of driving in 3 days though.\n\nother options?? Fly to San Sebastian, drive to Madrid?\n\nWhat's your thoughts?

Yeah you miss some nice scenery but the train and bus are both long and slow.\n\nTo get to Madrid things get more complicated.\n\nIf you happen to be into churning, it's a really good option to use avios to fly from San Sebastián or even Bilbao. It's best to transfer them to Iberia and book from there, but that gets a bit complicated and not worth going into unless you actually want to do it.\n\nYou can look into just paying for flights from Bilbao. Air Europa and Iberia fly that route. This is what my company normally uses to get people between the Bilbao and Madrid offices, but we are paying for time so it changes the cost/benefit a lot.\n\nYou can check the train schedule and prices at www.renfe.com. Unfortunately the trains to the Basque Country are rather slow and actually slower than just driving so keep that in mind.\n\nPersonally, I would actually probably go with the bus. www.alsa.es is the website of the bus company. There is normal service and then Supra service. If it's not too much of a price difference, I find the Supra to be very worth it. It's like long haul business class on an airplane. The seat doesn't turn into a bed or anything, but it's very comfortable and you have an in seat entertainment system. The premium is even more swanky if you really want to splurge."

I just cannot do the humidity in the summer so I chose a place that is dry. \nYou will find a great international crowd in Barcelona as well as a lot more music.\n\nTake your time trying to find an apartment. The prices are skyrocketing due to AirBnB and investment properties so finding a good place that is cheap will be difficult. \n\nBe prepared in a lot of areas for the streets to be very noisy very late in the evenings. So if you crave a quiet life pick your neighborhood carefully. Go visit the area in the morning, evening and late at night to get an idea. I have found that in some places in Granada if you are living on the street where everyone walks to the late night clubs you will hear shouting and singing between 3-6 in the morning which is quite a nuisance. \n\nAbout the health insurance. You will probably need a full physical to get it and it can run you up to 200 euros to get it done but once you have that then you can qualify for insurance. Once you are settled in and paying taxes on whatever income you have then you can qualify for state health insurance which is essentially free. And, trust me the hospitals are very good here. \n\nYou will need your NIE number in order to get internet arranged. There is simply no other good option.\n\nDefinitely check out heating in the apartment since it gets cold and damp in Barcelona. Electricity is very expensive here. My heating is electric as is my air conditioning. My bills can run between 40-183 Euros depending on the time of the year. \n\nSo yeah. One question? Why not move to Porto or Lisbon? I really prefer those cities much more than the ones in Spain. "

It can get 44 Celcius in the shadow. As you are a canadian I will fall for the stereotypes and belive that you don't have much experience with heat so I would recommend you to skip Andalucia region in august or at least prepare the sunblocker 100 spf, is very common to see foreigns red as tomatoes in spain in summer.\n\nIf heat is not a problem you will love Seville.

And walk the city centre and live the life of the city.\n\nIMHO avoid Valencia completely and as others suggested go north to Bilbao. There you can drink sidra and eat pintxos and visit the Guggenheim Museum.\n\nThis way you're visiting more cultures inside Spain: Madrid (central), Bilbao (north), Barcelona (mediterranean) and Sevilla (south, Andalucian: they're special on they own).\n"

I like to think of Sevilla as the heart of spain and people there is very, very nice.\nAlso, if you want to control the budget A LOT, just don't go to tourist traps. those are usually restaurants with big paella signs. Ask a local or use tripadvisor.\nIn Barcelona you should visit Gaudi architecture(park Güell, sagrada familia, la pedrera, etc...), La Basílica de Santa María del Mar, Ciutadella Park, the born market. there's a little sqare... It's kinda a hidden place but I really like it. Still breathes semi-recent history. It's Called Plaça felip Neri and it's totally  my favourite place in Barcelona. You should inform yourself what happened there and see it with your own eyes.\nTo end the visit in Barcelona you should totally go to la font Magica. It's free and really beautiful. In august expect LOTS of people there. Can't really talk about Valencia, I went there just once and did not like it at all. But there are some museums worth cheking out.

It was one of the capitals of the roman empire and there are some great museums and ruins (colosseum, walls, circus). The old town, including the cathedral, is within the roman walls at the top of the hill, and is such a beautiful place to wander around for a day.

           "Just to chime in with/against others, I'd recommend at least one or two days more in Madrid. 4-5 days in Barcelona is a good idea IMO - you could even do a day trip to Girona, probably Catalonia's most beautiful city and a GoT filming location, if that interests you.\n\nI'd skip Valencia. It's a nice town but there really isn't a huge amount to see. If you had an extra week or two, I'd say include it. Same goes for Bilbao. Save these places for your next trip.\n\nGranada is a must. The Alhambra is the finest example of Islamic architecture in Europe, and IMO one of the most beautiful buildings in the world.\n\nSeville is also lovely. Just spending half a day going to a couple of bars, drinking chilled red wine and eating delicious tapas is one of my fondest memories of traveling in Spain.\n\nWhen I've traveled in the past, I've done 2 different types of trip: the type where we have tried to fit a dozen things in and the type where we stuck to 2-3 places. The second type is, in my opinion, a far better way of doing it, for two reasons: firstly, you can never see everything, so there's no point trying. Secondly, if you rush around you'll never really experience Spain in summer, which is all about slowing down. It's like Menorca, where we go on vacation most years (and where you must go on your next trip!) - you can tell how long people have been on the island by how they behave. New arrivals rush around, people who have been for a week or two are way more chilled.\n\nSo yeah, best bet is: Madrid > BCN > Granada > Seville > Madrid.\n\nAnyway, for Barcelona and environs, I'm a mod on the /r/Barcelona sub.

If you and your wife are into night life, then Mae West is an awesome discoteca. The shops are good and all located down one street in the central area of town (Reyes Catolicos I believe). There's only two American chain restaurants (last time I checked)- Dunkin Donuts & Burger King.

If you want to see Alhambra get tickets asap. You don't need a lot of time in Valencia either but there are some things worth seeing (Biografico was awesome!)

If you want a good beach day go somewhere on Costa Brava or to Casteldefels. Madrid has many many beautiful museums and parks while Barcelona mostly offers building tours of Gaudi's work and the Picasso Museum (those the museum of art of Catalunya was very nice).

The actual gist of the exchange is cultural. You stay with host families through this too. I know for a fact there is a Turkish national organisation, got some friends in Turkey thanks to YFU.\n\nAlso, try erasmus+ and european union programmes. There might be offers, as even though Turkey is not in the EU, sometimes they do things together. These programmes would be the best as there are chances you wouldn't have to pay and may have costs covered. Spain has a pretty strong youth \"houses\"/clubs network very interconnected with EU programmes. Try also youth working camps, and wwoof. There are people everywhere that host people in exchange for some work, in wwoof these places tend to be farms, people opening eco villages and such vibe.\n\nLastly, if I may, if you want to learn Spanish I wouldn't recommend going to Madrid or Barcelona.

It seems very standard freeway/ rural driving. I saw one comment about how stressful the drive to Madrid is, but he got tons of down votes so I'm guessing you all don't agree :).\n\nThx!!"

Narrow streets full of tiny bars and cafes with excellent drinks.\n\nLeon and Burgos - The pilgrims give these cities a breathless fervour that so obviously inspired the works that fill them.  Also the Museum of Human of Human Evolution was fantastic.\n\nSan Sebatian - A vacationers paradise.  Food, drink, relaxing in the sun, calm  active bays and beaches.  If there is any activity you find fun, then you can find it here.\n\nBarcelona -  The Sagrada familia was the single most stunning work I saw.

This is one of many posts that I have already started making and will probably keep making as I prepare to try to spend 3 years in Spain starting between 6-9/2017.

I've spent two weeks there in the past, and really enjoyed it. I was in an Airbnb that time, so I know a lot about food shopping and such there. If anyone has recommendations of other cities I'm totally willing to entertain other ones! But the international airport and relatively (according to Numbeo at least) low cost of living are two of my big factors.\n\nAnyway, to the point!

The dates, however, are not flexible.\n\nFor the most part, just want to know if my itinerary makes sense - if I will have enough time to do everything, or if I will have more time than I think. Ive traveled all over the world but haven't done much of Europe.\n\nAny insight, and suggestions on what to see, where to go, where to stay, mode of transport are extremely welcome.\n\nReddit has always been a great resource for advice - I basically planned my whole 2 week trip to Washington/Oregon around advice from redditors and would have missed a lot if it wasn't for them so I'm hoping to find the same love here!\n\nJuly 5: Fly from Miami to Lisbon\n\nJuly 6-9: Airbnb in Lisbon (NOS ALIVE music festival during the nights)\n\nJuly 10: Early flight from Lisbon to Madrid\n\nJuly 11: Madrid\n\nJuly 12: Early bus to Pamplona\n\nJuly 13: Pamplona for Running of the Bulls\n\nJuly 14: Run with Bulls in AM ---> Bus to Biarritz\n\nJuly 15: Biarritz\n\nJuly 16: Fly/Train to Paris\n\nJuly 17-19: Paris\n\nJuly 20: Fly Home to Miami\n\nThanks everyone - looking forward to any and all suggestions!\n"

           "Any experiences with the Alpujarras in late December? Hi everyone!\n\nI've rented an adorable AirBnB in Pampaneira for a few days in late December, and I have a few questions for anyone familiar with the area. \n\nI'm pretty cold-hardy (having lived in Minnesota for four years, the winter lows occasionally getting to -34F/-36C), but I've been getting conflicting information about the climate and I need to know how to pack! According to a variety of weather websites, the average highs are a relatively sultry 55F/13C and the lows hover above freezing. To me, that's pleasantly brisk jacket weather. But I've seen pictures and heard-tell about relatively significant/lasting snowfall in the mountain villages-- are there typically wild swings in temperature? Should I be prepared for days that don't get much above freezing? Or is seriously wintry weather a bit of a freak event in the Alpujarras?\n\nOn a related note, I'm debating whether to rent a car or to take the bus from Granada. The car would be expensive and a pain in the butt, but would give me more freedom to explore other villages. The bus is very cheap, but I'm worried about reliability-- and being able to get back to Granada on New Years Eve. What would you recommend? \n\nFinally, are there extensive seasonal closures? My main goal in Pampaneira is to snuggle up with my partner by the fire and drink wine and enjoy jamon in the cute cottage we're renting, but it would be nice to be able to get basic provisions and have a dinner somewhere. :)\n\nThanks for your help, r/spain! I can't wait to visit your beautiful country.     "

Generally they have 3 buses a day to Pampaneira, but I am not sure if they run all 3 in the winter (much less on new years/nochevieja). \n\nI'll put Travelez on my list!!\n\nThanks again. :)"

Andalucia are the most friendly and nearliest people of spain (well, at least is his stereotype), they have a \"south\" accent really characteristic.

I don't know if it bothers me too much as I tend to have a gift for tuning noise out. I also experienced the noise in Barcelona as the first part of my stay was right in the heart of the gothic. The second part of my stay was in Horta Guinardo, which is a very lovely neighborhood and much more quiet. I think I preferred being where all the action was in the city center. I definitely love the various music festivals in Barcelona. This year I went to Sonar which was a lot of fun. \n\nI'm glad to hear that the hospitals are great. I'm pretty much sick of healthcare in the US. \n\nAs far a Spain over Portugal, I think the marijuana social clubs in Spain are really appealing to me. I don't drink very often, but I do enjoy smoking which helps me a lot with sleep issues that I have. From what I understand marijuana can be a little more difficult to acquire in Portugal.

           "2 months vacation in Spain with infant Hello!\n\nWe (2 adults + 1,5 years old baby) are planning a 2 months long vacation in October + November.\n Mainly we want to relax and spent time in nature - hiking, sightseeing, sea watching etc. - no partying or some other intense activities. Living close to the beach (beachfront ideally with balcony towards sea) is a must for us. \n\nJust to relax, calm down and spent time together with no disturbations in nice environment.\n\nMy questions are :\n\n1) Which part of Spain would you recommend? As i said above, we want to relax on beach, take long walks in nature, no nightlife. We prefer smaller city, not very touristy oriented (we are travelling in offseason anyway), few friendly restaurants, cafes and one supermarket. Thats all we need. We will have car. \n\nWe are considering either: \n\n> Murcia region - Mazarron, Águilas or La Manga.\n\n> Almería\n\n> Valencia\n\n> Barcelona\n\n2) Is weather in october, november still suitable for beach activities? Can we swim till late november?\n\n3) As we also love hiking in mountains, ideal place should be also in reasonable travelling distance to mountains (or atleast some nature reserve with hills)\n\n4) I suppose accomodation will be no problem in October - we want to rent a house / flat via Airbnb, i am expecting to pay maximum 1100$ / month for appartment with kitchen + 2 rooms, ideally in beachfront with seaviews and balcony. There are numerous seaside flats in large building complexes, ranging from 600$/month - how can it be so inexpensive? Where is the catch?\n\n5) I will try to hold our monthly budget around 700$ or so (no eating out, we are qute savy). Is it reasonable?\n\nThank you!"

My basic itinerary:\n\nLondon 2 days ->>> Rome 7 days >>> Barcelona 7 days. >>>Munich 4 days >>>Budapest 5 days>>> Dublin 5 days>>>Amsterdam 4 days\n\nSome stuff about me and my goals for the trip:\n\n* I am a single laid back guy that will be traveling alone.\n* I like to meet people, drink and party. \n* I plan to stay at party hostels for 3/4 of the trip and maybe airbnb 25% of the time for a breather.\n* I would love to see old architecture, castles, and the nature that some of these countries have to offer.\n* I really like super local stuff including hole in the wall restaurants, little known gems, and small towns.\n* I also don't mind touristy stuff, some of the most beautiful places are popular for a reason. \n* I adore tasty food and wine.\n\n**Plan for Spain:**\nI will be flying into Barcelona and staying at the Kabul Party Hostel for 3-4 nights. Still have no idea where to go or what to check out.\nAfterwards I was thinking about heading down the coast as I've heard good things, Maybe I'll take a train ride to Valencia or take a flight out to Palma or Ibiza for the rest of the week. \n\nOR I also have friends in Madrid but they are pretty busy right now for me to stay with them but it wouldn't hurt to say hi if there is some beautiful things along the way.\n\nAnyway I appreciate any general or specific tips!

    "## 8. Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this analysis, we have gained significant insights into the public perception of Airbnb's service within the context of Spanish tourism during the summer of 2024, particularly concerning the phenomenon of tourism saturation and the touristification of residential neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "🚩Distribution of Sentiments: According to the results, the majority of comments are neutral (44.2%), which could reflect a resigned acceptance of the service amidst growing concerns about tourism saturation. Negative comments account for 32.5%, suggesting significant criticism likely centered around the negative repercussions of tourism on the local community, such as neighborhood identity loss and rising prices. Positive comments make up 23.3%, indicating that although there are satisfied users, they are fewer in comparison to more critical or neutral views.\n",
    "\n",
    "🚩Proportion of Sentiments: This chart highlights that the neutral and negative perceptions might be influenced by the view that Airbnb contributes to broader issues like touristification, which affects the quality of life of permanent residents and transforms neighborhoods into areas primarily oriented towards tourism.\n",
    "\n",
    "🚩Sentiment Scores: The variability in scores could be indicative of the diverse experiences of users, fluctuating between the utility of the service and its negative impact on local communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "🩹Implications for Airbnb:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅Response to Tourism Saturation: It is crucial for Airbnb to implement strategies that mitigate the negative effects of mass tourism, such as supporting regulations that limit the number of properties available for short-term rentals in critical areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅Promotion of Responsible Tourism: Encouraging a culture of responsible tourism among Airbnb users, highlighting the importance of respecting local communities and their traditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅Community Integration Initiatives: Developing programs that better integrate tourists with local communities, supporting community-beneficial projects, and ensuring that a portion of the revenue generated by Airbnb contributes to local development.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis provides a clear view of how Airbnb's service is perceived in relation to contemporary tourism challenges, offering a basis for future strategies that seek not only to improve the service's perception but also address the socioeconomic impacts on host communities."

## 8. Conclusions

Through this analysis, we have gained significant insights into the public perception of Airbnb's service within the context of Spanish tourism during the summer of 2024, particularly concerning the phenomenon of tourism saturation and the touristification of residential neighborhoods.

üö©Distribution of Sentiments: According to the results, the majority of comments are neutral (44.2%), which could reflect a resigned acceptance of the service amidst growing concerns about tourism saturation. Negative comments account for 32.5%, suggesting significant criticism likely centered around the negative repercussions of tourism on the local community, such as neighborhood identity loss and rising prices. Positive comments make up 23.3%, indicating that although there are satisfied users, they are fewer in comparison to more critical or neutral views.

üö©Proportion of Sentiments: This chart highlights that the neutral and negative perceptions might be influenced by the view that Airbnb contributes to broader issues like touristification, which affects the quality of life of permanent residents and transforms neighborhoods into areas primarily oriented towards tourism.

üö©Sentiment Scores: The variability in scores could be indicative of the diverse experiences of users, fluctuating between the utility of the service and its negative impact on local communities.

ü©πImplications for Airbnb:

‚úÖResponse to Tourism Saturation: It is crucial for Airbnb to implement strategies that mitigate the negative effects of mass tourism, such as supporting regulations that limit the number of properties available for short-term rentals in critical areas.

‚úÖPromotion of Responsible Tourism: Encouraging a culture of responsible tourism among Airbnb users, highlighting the importance of respecting local communities and their traditions.

‚úÖCommunity Integration Initiatives: Developing programs that better integrate tourists with local communities, supporting community-beneficial projects, and ensuring that a portion of the revenue generated by Airbnb contributes to local development.

This analysis provides a clear view of how Airbnb's service is perceived in relation to contemporary tourism challenges, offering a basis for future strategies that seek not only to improve the service's perception but also address the socioeconomic impacts on host communities.
